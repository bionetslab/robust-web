1. First start redis server:
(Redis server has to be run before celery. Otherwise, celery will throw error.)

Simply type 'redis-server' on the terminal.

Redis runs on port 6379 by default.

2. Then start celery server:

Simply type 'celery -A app.celery worker --loglevel=info' on the terminal.

You should see a statement that says 'Connected to redis://localhost:6379/'

3. Finally, run the web app:

Type 'python3 app.py' on the terminal.

Port: 5000 (that is, the web app can be accessed locally at: http://127.0.0.1:5000/)

We can change the port that the Flask app is running on by changing "app.run()" in app.py to "app.run(port='ENTER_DESIRED_PORT_NUMBER')".
